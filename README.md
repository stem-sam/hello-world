Hello!

Sam here. A goal of mine is to become a competent computational biologist at the cutting edge of science and medicine. I hope to accomplish this goal by bridging tools developed in molecular biology with the latest technology in genome sciences. Such aspirations will enable me to tackle the world's most pressing health issues head-on. Knowledge is power. Oh yea, Einstein is pretty cool.
